This repo is for tabulation approaches to Dynamic Programing algorithms

Tabulation Recipe:
- visualize the problem as a table
- size the table based on the inputs
- initialize the table with default values
- seed the trivial answer into the table (ex 1, 1 for f0 and f1 for fib)
- iterate through the table
- fill further positions based on the current position
